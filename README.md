# Brent-Kung 32-Bit Adder
Project by Yashvardhan Singh - 4th Semester Student - Electronics Engg. (VLSI Design & Technology) Undergraduate Student - Dept. of ECE, MIT, Manipal.
## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of a **32-bit Brent-Kung Adder (BKA)**, a parallel-prefix adder architecture known for its efficiency in reducing delay while maintaining a balanced trade-off in power and area. The project includes **Verilog** implementations, testbenches, synthesis reports, and Tcl scripts for simulation and synthesis.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/BrentKungAdder.git
   cd BrentKungAdder
   ```
2. Run the testbench in your preferred **Verilog simulator**:
   ```sh
   iverilog -o brentkung_test brentkung32.v brentkung32_tb.v
   vvp brentkung_test
   ```
